# TwitterSentiment-UkraineRussia
This project explores public opinion during the Ukraine-Russia War in 2022, utilizing advanced sentiment analysis models and techniques on Twitter data. The primary goal is to decode public sentiments and understand the impact of echo chambers, where information and opinions can become insular and potentially divergent from objective reality.
This study delves into public opinion mining during the Ukraine-Russia War in 2022, utilizing advanced sentiment analysis techniques on Twitter data. The primary objective is to decipher public sentiments expressed on the platform and understand the impact of echo chambers, where information and opinions can become insular and potentially divergent from objective reality. By employing state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models, BERT and RoBERTa, the research aims to assess their precision, recall, and F1-scores in accurately classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral within tweets related to the conflict.

An extensive dataset of English-language tweets associated with the Ukraine-Russia War was meticulously curated from Twitter's API for this study. Both BERT and RoBERTa models demonstrated an overall accuracy score of 94%, showcasing their robust capabilities. The performance of these models was thoroughly evaluated using essential metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and areas for improvement.

The findings underscore the pivotal role of advanced sentiment analysis models in deciphering public sentiments during complex global events. They highlight the efficacy of BERT and RoBERTa in capturing nuanced distinctions in public opinion, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of information dissemination during crises. Furthermore, the research emphasizes the profound impact of echo chambers in shaping and reinforcing public opinions, offering insights into how sentiments can be influenced or manipulated within these insular environments.

By comparing the performance of BERT and RoBERTa, the study contributes to the broader field of sentiment analysis and its application in real-world scenarios. It sheds light on the importance of employing sophisticated models to enhance our comprehension of public sentiments during pivotal events. The research findings not only validate the effectiveness of these models but also provide a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in sentiment analysis and the influence of echo chambers on public opinion.

In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of using advanced sentiment analysis techniques to explore public opinion during major global events like the Ukraine-Russia War. The insights gained from this research enrich our understanding of information dissemination and public sentiment, emphasizing the critical role of echo chambers in shaping public opinion.
